## Synopsis

In a complex system with interacting queues and thousands of  independent actors, each trying to optimize their personal experience, a small change in certain positive tipping points can have cascading effects all over the system.

By having a digital twin and simulating assumptions we can identify those points and use them to cause the desired effect of reducing waiting times.
